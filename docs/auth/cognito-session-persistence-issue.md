# Cognito Session Persistence Issue

## Overview

When implementing sign out functionality, we discovered that Cognito's token revocation process is separate from NextAuth.js's session management. This means that even after clearing NextAuth.js's internal session and cookies, the Cognito tokens can remain valid, allowing automatic re-authentication.

To address this, we added a direct token revocation request to Cognito's `/revoke` endpoint in our sign out flow. This request attempts to invalidate the refresh token on Cognito's side. However, we're still seeing cases where users can automatically re-authenticate after signing out, suggesting that either:

1. The token revocation isn't fully effective
2. There's another mechanism at play that we haven't identified yet

## The Problem

Our current sign out flow:

1. Revokes the refresh token with Cognito
2. Clears NextAuth.js session and cookies
3. Redirects to the start page

However, Cognito's token revocation process is independent of NextAuth.js's session management. This leads to:

- Users being automatically re-authenticated after signing out
- Inconsistent state between NextAuth.js's session and Cognito's token validity
- Potential security concerns with lingering valid tokens

## Technical Details

- NextAuth.js manages its session through cookies and internal state
- Cognito manages authentication through:
  - Access tokens
  - Refresh tokens
  - Token revocation endpoints
- These systems operate independently, requiring explicit token revocation on both sides

## Current Solution

Our `signOut` function now:

1. Attempts to revoke the refresh token with Cognito first
2. Only proceeds with NextAuth.js sign out after successful token revocation
3. Includes error handling to ensure NextAuth.js cleanup even if Cognito revocation fails

## Future Considerations

1. Investigate additional Cognito token revocation methods
2. Consider implementing a more comprehensive sign out flow that:
   - Revokes all tokens (access and refresh)
   - Ensures complete token invalidation on both sides
3. Add monitoring for failed sign out attempts

## Testing Implications

When writing tests for authentication flows:

1. Ensure both NextAuth.js session and Cognito tokens are properly revoked
2. Verify that automatic re-authentication doesn't occur after sign out
3. Test error scenarios during sign out
4. Consider adding specific test cases for token revocation issues
