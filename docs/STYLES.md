# Repository Standards

This project follows the following standards:

## Backticks for Styled Components

Styled components should use backticks (`) for styling, as is standard in styled components. This ensures consistency and readability in the codebase.

## Transient Props for Styling-Only Props

[Transient props ($)](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#transient-props) should be used for non-functional props that are for styling only.
This helps to clearly distinguish between functional and non-functional props, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Gov UK Constants for Variables

Variables for colours, font styles, weights, padding, etc., should use Gov UK constants. This helps to maintain consistency and ensures that we better follow Gov UK guidelines.
