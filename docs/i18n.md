# i18n Documentation

## Overview

We use the [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) package for internationalization (i18n) in our Next.js application. This allows us to manage UI copy in a structured manner, enabling easier future localisation and maintaining a consistent approach for front-end developers.

## Structure

- **Localization Files:**
  - All UI copy is stored in JSON files located inside the `public/locales/*` directory. For example, you can find common translations in `public/locales/common.json`.
- **Current Language Support:**
  - We are currently supporting English only, but this setup provides a foundation for future product changes and multilingual support.

## Integration with Next.js 14 App Router

With the migration to Next.js 14's App Router architecture, including React Server Components (RSC) and client components, implementing i18n requires careful handling:

### Client Components

- **Import Statement:**

  - Use the following import to access translation functionality:
    ```javascript
    import { useTranslation } from '@/app/i18n/client'
    ```

- **Usage:**
  - To retrieve translations, use the following syntax:
    ```javascript
    const { t } = useTranslation('common')
    ...
    <p>{t('exampleKey')}</p>
    ```
  - **Note:** This must NOT be an async function.

### Server Components

- **Import Statement:**

  - For server components, use this import to access translations:
    ```javascript
    import { getServerTranslation } from '@/app/i18n'
    ```

- **Usage:**
  - To retrieve translations, the following syntax is used:
    ```javascript
    const { t } = await getServerTranslation('common')
    ...
    <p>{t('exampleKey')}</p>
    ```

## Conclusion

Implementing i18n with the i18next package in our Next.js application allows for efficient management of UI copy and provides a scalable structure for future internationalization needs. By following the guidelines for both client and server components, we can ensure a consistent user experience across our application.
